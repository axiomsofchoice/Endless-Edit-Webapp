/**
 * <p>A goal is something a collaborator autonomously declares.
 * The incentive system assigns scores to a collaborator based
 * how the actions they perform help to satisfy goals.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A goal must satisfy the following criteria:
 *     <li>It must declare the valid actions which collaborators
 *     can perform which will aid in satisfying the goal.</li>
 *     <li>It must provide deterministic methods for evaluating 
 *     the outcomes of actions performed by collaborators to
 *     measure the extent to which they satisfy the goal.</li>
 *     <li>Evaluation methods must provide metrics that satisfy 
 *     the laws for metrics.</li>
 *     <li>It should provide ways of determining what sorts of
 *     actions are valid.</li>
