	<h2>About</h2>
	<p><em>Endless Edit</em> is a prototype exteme collaboration platform.
	It takes the form of a project to collaboratively author a report about
	the findings of the project.</p>
	
	<p>The project draws it's influences from prior projects such as
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage">The Million Dollar Homepage</a>
	and <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">Russell and Norvig</a>'s seminal description of Goal-Based
	<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/aima1e/chapter02.pdf">Intelligent Agents</a>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Platform Details</h2>
		<h3>The editable document</h3>
		<p>The project arena is a single editable document. All
		collaborators can 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Collaborator goals</h3>
		<p>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Collaboration actions and network influence</h3>
		<p>How does a collaborator come up with the text they declare
		as their goal? One mechanism for doing this is to compare their
		goal with those others to see if they agree or disagree with the
		proposed directions they wish to take the project. In particular
		the collaborators who are in the immediate vicinity of a
		collaborator will have a direct effect on a collaborator's ability
		to acheive their decalred goals.</p>
		<p>If everyone within a few
		characters of a collaborator agree on the form the sentence
		they're in should take then there's a good chance that they will
		collectively acheive their goals. However, if they all disagree
		it's almost certain that none of them will achieve their goals
		purely by chance.</p>
