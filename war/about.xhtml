	<h2>About</h2>
	<p><em>Endless Edit</em> is a prototype exteme collaboration platform.
	It takes the form of a project to collaboratively author a report about
	the findings of the project.</p>
	
	<p>The project draws it's influences from prior projects such as
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage">The Million Dollar Homepage</a>
	and <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">Russell and Norvig</a>'s seminal description of Goal-Based
	<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/aima1e/chapter02.pdf">Intelligent Agents</a>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Platform Details</h2>
		<h3>The editable document</h3>
		<p>The project arena is a single editable document. All
		collaborators can 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Collaborator goals</h3>
		<p>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Collaboration actions and network influence</h3>
		<p>How does a collaborator come up with the text they declare
		as their goal? One mechanism for doing this is to compare their
		goal with those of others to see if they agree or disagree with the
		proposed directions they wish to take the project. In particular
		the collaborators who are in the immediate vicinity of a
		collaborator will have a direct effect on a collaborator's ability
		to acheive their declared goals.</p>
		<p>If everyone within a few
		characters of a collaborator agree on the form the sentence
		they're in should take then there's a good chance that they will
		collectively acheive their goals. However, if they all disagree
		it's almost certain that none of them will achieve their goals
		purely by chance.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>Contrast this with more traditional collaborative document
		editting systems such as wikis. Since editors have full editorial
		control of the document this has lead to numerous examples of
		metastable situations where no consensus could
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view">Nuetral Point of View</a>.
		Within the <em>Endless Edit</em> platform such situations will
		generally result in incoherent sentences. More interestingly
		though the divisions in the community will be evident by the
		collaborative behaviour of the collaborators. In this respect
		the network data will tell a more important story than the
		document itself will.</p>
		<p>One of world's largest wikis, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>,
		is clear that the type of collaboration it supports
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_democracy">
		is not a democracy</a>, by which is meant that consensus is not to be reached
		by forms of voting but instead through edits and discussion. <em>Endless Edit</em>
		is a democracy in the sense that each collaborator can only <em>directly</em>
		affect (at most) a single character in the document and no other collaborator can
		make changes to that same character.
